# <h2> Principal Component Analysis- Dimensionality Reduction 
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset.
To perform dimensionality reduction while preserving as much of the randomness in the high-dimensional space as possible
PCA is mainly concerned with identifying correlations in the data.

# <h2> KNN - (K- Nearest Neigbour)-classification
  A powerful classification algorithm used in pattern recognition.An object (a new instance) is classified by a majority votes for its neighbor classes.The object is assigned to the most common class amongst its K nearest neighbors.(measured by a distant function )Distance Measures

# <h2> Naive Bayes Classifier-classification
  predicts categorical class labels.classifies data (constructs a model) based on thetraining set and the values (class labels) in a classifying attribute and uses it in classifying new data
Statistical method for classification.
Supervised Learning Method.Can solve problems involving both categorical and continuous valued attributes.

# <h2> K-means Clustering Techniques-clustering
  K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group

# <h2> Support Vector Machines (SVM)-classification
  In machine learning, support vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis.
Non probabilistic binary linear classifier
For every linearly separable data, there exist infinite number of separating hyperplanes. Hence, we must choose the most suitable one for classification.
Finding the shortest distance(An SVM is simply a linear discriminant which tries to build a hyperplane such that it has a large margin.)
